### Approach Taken

- Create game board and divide the game's pieces among the two players.
- Provide a button to switch controls between both players.
- Provides 2 unique colors for both players to provide a visual difference.
- Provides a visual text/icon that shows which Player's turn is it.
- Check to see if the 2 cells clicked are nearby or not with their positions.
- Check to see if the 2 cells clicked belong to the same player or not.
- Create and display 2 dices after 2 cells were clicked back to back.
- Assign a different number value to all of the game board's pieces.
- Use the number value to determine the amount of rolls and total number on a dice.
- Always check to see if all of the pieces were taken by a Player to see if someone won.
