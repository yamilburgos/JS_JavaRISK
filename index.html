            <h2>The JavaScript Conquest Game</h2>
            <p>
                The objective of the game is to conquer the gameboard by changing all the board's territories to your player's color. You do this
                by attacking the other Player's territory and attempt to capture them. You also need to make sure that your own territories are
                well-defended.

                <li> - The board is always split in half for both players. Both the territory and the amount of power given is random.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Every turn the power of the Player's territories increases by 1, so playing defense for a turn is viable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - You can only attack adjacent territories, no diagonals! Can only attack if your territory's power is greater than 1.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - You can attack any number of times with your territories until you end your turn. Attacking is always optional!
                </li>
                <li>
                    - The chance of taking the enemy's territory depends on your territory's power, the greater the number, the better.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - You can use your captured territory for further attacks. Be warned that the attacking territory is left with a power of one.
                </li>
