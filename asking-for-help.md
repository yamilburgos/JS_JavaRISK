# How to Ask Questions on Github
In order to receive help on an issue you are having during your development process you must do the following:
* Step 1 - Research independently
* Step 2 - Reach out to the tech community, TA's, peers, Stack Overflow. If this is unsuccessful...
* Step 3 - Submit a Github Issue to Your Game Repo **Tagging your Squad Leader**

Below is a guide for the information that must be included when submitting an issue.
It is EXPECTED that you will try to debug/solve an issue _prior_ to submitting a request for help on Github.

### Context
When submitting an issue, provide context as to what the problem is. This includes but is not limited to:
- What you are trying to do
- Detailed description of the bug or error
- Relevant code/files/errors, screenshots
- Technologies being used/attempted

### What have you tried?
Give info about what you have done to solve the problem. Including but not limited to:
- Documentation you have looked at
- Steps you have taken to solve the problem
- Resources you have used

### Question
What would you like help with specifically?

For an example: [Sample Question](https://gist.github.com/DrRobotmck/6c7f464ef64b131097fa)

P.S. Make sure to add the instructors as collaborators!!!

This way you will be able to use "@instructorGitHubHandle" command and assign your squad leader to the issue. This way they will get a notification.
